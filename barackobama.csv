2020-01-13 14:13:13,False,"Oscar nominations came out today and I’m glad to see American Factory’s nod for Best Documentary. I like this film for its nuanced, honest portrayal of the way a changing global economy plays out in real lives. It offers a window into people as they actually are and it’s the kind of story we don’t see often enough. This is exactly what Michelle and I hope to achieve through Higher Ground. Congratulations to the incredible filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar, and the entire team!",https://instagram.fnag1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/81242731_121878659312636_5653829913521655556_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fnag1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=z-TAuoJBMOUAX_rkGFX&oh=1c5df3aa7f6bff490b86f0d7306d280c&oe=5EBB5183,754804,5221,26608995

2019-12-29 17:04:23,False,"Next up are my favorite movies and TV shows of 2019. This year’s list includes everything from explorations of class dynamics and relationships, to an inspired reboot of a classic graphic novel, to a portal back to one of the most special places in history — an Aretha Franklin concert. Of course, there’s also American Factory, a film from our own production company, Higher Ground, that was recently shortlisted for an Oscar. It’s our first offering in partnership with Netflix, and I’m excited about the other projects we’ve got in the works.

2019-12-28 21:17:55,False,"Over the next few days, I’ll be sharing my annual list of favorites — books, films, and music — with all of you. This has become a fun little tradition for me, and I hope it is for you, too. Because while each of us has plenty that keeps us busy—work and family life, social and volunteer commitments—outlets like literature and art can enhance our day-to-day experiences. They’re the fabric that helps make up a life—the album that lifts us up after a long day, the dog-eared paperback we grab off the shelf to give to a friend, the movie that makes us think and feel in a new way, works that simply help us escape for a bit. To start, here are the books that made the last year a little brighter for me. Most of them came out in 2019, but a few were older ones that were new to me this year. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.",https://instagram.fnag1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/77117515_2463968623865926_4199679646947292350_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fnag1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=2aUytWxPqZcAX9Ioa-H&oh=25c41e91037a98a4ce6a8eaca68044fa&oe=5ED310CC,1037115,15116,26608995

2019-12-13 18:08:39,False,"Growing up in Indonesia and Hawaii instilled in me a sense of cooperation and community.

2019-11-16 23:48:27,False,"Last night, I had the chance to sit down with Stacey Abrams to talk about how Democrats can win up and down the ballot in 2020. There’s a lot of great work already happening: Stacey’s Fair Fight effort to end voter suppression, Eric Holder’s National Democratic Redistricting Committee to draw fair maps, and a lot of big-hearted, forward-looking candidates and campaigns to get people registered and out to the polls.⁣

The truth is we win when people vote. The more energized we are, the better organized we are as a party, the better the outcome. We believe in the ideals of equality and democracy, freedom of thought and religion. We rally around the notion that we are all bound together and a belief that civil argument can lead us to a more perfect union. We commit ourselves to the principles that are embodied in our Constitution. And we have to remember that our faith is tested at hard times, not at easy times. That’s how this works. So I hope all of us—as citizens, as volunteers, as Americans who simply believe that we can make this country better—are ready to get marching, get organizing, and get voting. It’s up to us.",https://instagram.fnag1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/74673875_540141443499222_2773392451185614832_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fnag1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=WuNqtnsOSZAAX80UQyV&oh=5fc1070be0e00273b7646bf47ca436d5&oe=5EBB1458,597238,7303,26608995
